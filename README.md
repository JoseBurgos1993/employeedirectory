# Unit 19 React: Employee Directory
For this project, I created an app that takes 20 randomly generated employees from the API [randomuser](https://randomuser.me/) and allows you to sort or filter them.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/employeedirectory). The deployed page can be located [here](https://joseburgos1993.github.io/employeedirectory/).
